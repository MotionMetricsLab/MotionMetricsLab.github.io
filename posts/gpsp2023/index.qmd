Kassy and I attended the [Great Plains Student Psychology Convention](https://sites.google.com/emporia.edu/great-plains-2023) last weekend, hosted at Emporia State University. I gave an invited keynote address on "Reconsidering the Duchenne Smile," and Kassy presented her first AffCom lab poster on "Adult attachment and the working alliance during brief psychotherapy for depression." She was also awarded an *Outstanding Graduate Poster* award. Congratulations, Kassy!
