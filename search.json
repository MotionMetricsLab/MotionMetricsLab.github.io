    "text": "Project Summary\nWhich psychiatric symptoms and behaviors are the most important to assess and manage during critical points in psychiatric healthcare, such as the time leading up to hospital discharge? At present, psychiatry lacks objective tests that could inform this and other clinically challenging–and potentially costly–decisions. Establishing valid objective markers of psychiatric disease processes is especially challenging compared with the development of biomarkers in other fields. One key challenge is lack of available data from psychiatrically ill patients during key periods in their care trajectory, which the present project seeks to address. A second major challenge, also addressed as a core feature in this project, is the complex, context-dependence of human behavioral expression, which greatly complicates efforts to establish robust, objective measures that reflect underlying mental health disease processes. This project will address both barriers, introducing a new computational framework, named Context-Adaptive Multimodal Informatics, to identify and evaluate behavioral biomarkers related to discharge-readiness and symptoms in severe mental illness. The project aims to address five fundamental research challenges: (1) Acquire a multimodal psychiatric discharge-planning dataset of 400 inpatients with severe mental illness; (2) Create self-aware linear and neural models to identify multimodal behavioral biomarkers; (3) Develop context-sensitive linear and neural models to contextualize behavioral biomarkers and quantify the influence of context on behavior; (4) Build a new adaptive assessment planning framework which creates a personalized patient analysis to rank contexts and modalities for the next assessment session; (5) Assess the trustworthiness and generalizability of our measurements, models, and insights. This research will improve basic understanding of social context and behavioral biomarkers, build objective measures for mental health assessment, and more broadly, pave the way for a restructured care-delivery system in which resources are allocated intelligently to ensure assessments are informative with respect to desired clinical objectives."

This project will: (1) deepen our understanding of the trajectory leading to hospitalization discharge with knowledge about behavioral biomarkers and their relationship to symptoms and discharge-readiness; (2) contribute to the knowledge on how social context impacts patient’s behaviors since some symptoms or predictive biomarkers may only be seen in a specific context such as social or solitary interactions; and (3) contribute a credible, objective framework for behavioral measurement by defining interpretable biomarkers and latent factors for symptoms and discharge assessment. The project will also enable a judicious use of remote sensing and non-direct clinical encounters (e.g., telemedicine), which are increasingly viewed as essential capabilities in the medical fields to reduce costs while maintaining or elevating care standards."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEvaluating gait is part of every neurological movement disorder assessment. Generally, the physician assesses the patient based on their experience, but nowadays inertial measurement units (IMUs) are also often integrated in the assessment. Instrumented gait analysis has a longstanding tradition and temporal parameters are used to compare patient groups or trace disease progression over time. However, the day-to-day variability needs to be considered especially in specific patient cohorts. The aim of the study was to examine day-to-day variability of temporal gait parameters of two experimental conditions in a cohort of neurogeriatric patients using data extracted from a lower back-worn IMU. We recruited 49 participants (24 women (age: 78 years ± 6 years, BMI = 25.1 kg/m2 and 25 men (age: 77 years ± 6 years, BMI = 26.5 kg/m2)) from the neurogeriatric ward. Two gait distances (4 m and 20 m) were performed during the first session and repeated the following day. To evaluate reliability, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC2,k) and minimal detectable change (MDC) were calculated for the number of steps, step time, stride time, stance time, swing time, double limb support time, double limb support time variability, stride time variability and stride time asymmetry. The temporal gait parameters showed poor to moderate reliability with mean ICC and mean MDC95% values of 0.57 ± 0.18 and 52% ± 53%, respectively. Overall, only four out of the nine computed temporal gait parameters showed high relative reliability and good absolute reliability values. The reliability increased with walking distance. When only investigating steady-state walking during the 20 m walking condition, the relative and absolute reliability improved again. The most reliable parameters were swing time, stride time, step time and stance time. Study results demonstrate that reliability is an important factor to consider when working with IMU derived gait parameters in specific patient cohorts. This advocates for a careful parameter selection as not all parameters seem to be suitable when assessing gait in neurogeriatric patients."

    "text": "Abstract\nCare of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) will dramatically change in the upcoming years. The nationwide implementations of the patient-controlled electronic health record (EHR) and the technology-based home monitoring system will most probably be the cornerstones of this revolution. We speculate that, within the course of the next decade, EHRs will lead to a substantial empowerment of patients, and monitoring of motor and non-motor manifestations of PD will shift from the clinic to the home. As far as this can be foreseen, small, partly clothing-embedded and implanted sensor systems allowing passive (i.e., non-obtrusive) data collection will dominate the market. They will interoperate with the personal EHR and other potentially health-related electronic databases such as clinical warehouses and population health analytics platforms. Analysis software will be mainly built on artificial intelligence, and presentation of data will be intuitive. This scenario will eventually help both the patient and the medical professional by providing higher amounts of quality information about daily-relevant effects of disease and treatment, eventually allowing for a better and more personalized care."

Data collected in these ecologically valid, patient-relevant settings can overcome limitations of conventional clinical assessments, as they capture fluctuating and rare events. These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials. However, studies that directly compared assessments made in unsupervised and supervised (eg, in the laboratory or hospital) settings point to large disparities, even in the same parameters of mobility. These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed. To facilitate the successful adaptation of the unsupervised assessment of mobility into clinical practice and clinical trials, clinicians and researchers should consider these disparities and the multiple factors that contribute to them."

    "text": "Abstract\nIdentification of individual gait events is essential for clinical gait analysis, because it can be used for diagnostic purposes or tracking disease progression in neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. Previous research has shown that gait events can be detected from a shank-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), however detection performance was often evaluated only from straight-line walking. For use in daily life, the detection performance needs to be evaluated in curved walking and turning as well as in single-task and dual-task conditions.Participants (older adults, people with Parkinson’s disease, or people who had suffered from a stroke) performed three different walking trials: (1) straight-line walking, (2) slalom walking, (3) Stroop-and-walk trial. An optical motion capture system was used a reference system. Markers were attached to the heel and toe regions of the shoe, and participants wore IMUs on the lateral sides of both shanks. The angular velocity of the shank IMUs was used to detect instances of initial foot contact (IC) and final foot contact (FC), which were compared to reference values obtained from the marker trajectories.The detection method showed high recall, precision and F1 scores in different populations for both initial contacts and final contacts during straight-line walking. Shank-mounted IMUs can be used to detect gait events during straight-line walking, slalom walking and turning. However, more false events were observed during turning and more events were missed during turning. For use in daily life we recommend identifying turning before extracting temporal gait parameters from identified gait events."

    "text": "Abstract\nMany algorithms use 3D accelerometer and/or gyroscope data from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect gait events (i.e., initial and final foot contact). However, these algorithms often require knowledge about sensor orientation and use empirically derived thresholds. As alignment cannot always be controlled for in ambulatory assessments, methods are needed that require little knowledge on sensor location and orientation, e.g., a convolutional neural network-based deep learning model. Therefore, 157 participants from healthy and neurologically diseased cohorts walked 5 m distances at slow, preferred, and fast walking speed, while data were collected from IMUs on the left and right ankle and shank. Gait events were detected and stride parameters were extracted using a deep learning model and an optoelectronic motion capture (OMC) system for reference. The deep learning model consisted of convolutional layers using dilated convolutions, followed by two independent fully connected layers to predict whether a time step corresponded to the event of initial contact (IC) or final contact (FC), respectively. Results showed a high detection rate for both initial and final contacts across sensor locations (recall ≥92% , precision ≥97% ). Time agreement was excellent as witnessed from the median time error (0.005 s) and corresponding inter-quartile range (0.020 s). The extracted stride-specific parameters were in good agreement with parameters derived from the OMC system (maximum mean difference 0.003 s and corresponding maximum limits of agreement (−0.049 s, 0.051 s) for a 95% confidence level). Thus, the deep learning approach was considered a valid approach for detecting gait events and extracting stride-specific parameters with little knowledge on exact IMU location and orientation in conditions with and without walking pathologies due to neurological diseases."
