## About me
My research focuses on understanding and characterizing the biomechanics of human movement, using theoretical frameworks and experimental studies. I am mainly interested in understanding the exploited motor strategies that help to explain the movements. The use of motion analysis combined with biomechanical protocols allows developing an understanding of how motor actions are planned and executed.
