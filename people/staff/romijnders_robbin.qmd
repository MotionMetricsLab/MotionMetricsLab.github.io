## About me

I am an electrical and information engineer with a profound interest in the intersection of engineering and biomedical sciences, particularly as they apply to human health and medical technology. My educational journey in biomedical engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology laid a strong foundation in this interdisciplinary field. This was further enriched by my pursuit of a Ph.D. in Electrical and Information Engineering at Kiel University, where I delved deep into the complexities of integrating engineering principles with biological systems.

My research trajectory has been marked by a consistent focus on applying engineering solutions to medical challenges. My work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein epitomizes this, where I employ my engineering expertise to contribute to medical research. This role, coupled with my previous experience as a doctoral researcher at the same institution and Kiel University, reflects my dedication to advancing healthcare through engineering innovations. Additionally, my time as a CAE Simulation Engineer at Code Product Solutions showcases my ability to apply complex engineering concepts in practical settings.

Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in scientific research, as evidenced by my numerous publications. These works, focusing on topics such as gait analysis in Parkinson's disease and the development of algorithms for gait event detection, highlight my commitment to leveraging engineering for medical advancements. My approach is characterized by a unique blend of technical engineering skills and a deep understanding of biomedical applications, positioning me at the forefront of innovation in medical technology.
