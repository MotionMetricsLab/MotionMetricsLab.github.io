    "text": "For Undergraduate Students\nThe lab is frequently home to undergraduate students from the Psychology and Behavioral Neuroscience departments (and occasionally others).\nUndergraduate students work as research assistants, learning about the scientific method and assisting in the collection and processing of research data. Many enroll in PSYC 480 and receive credit hours for this work. Research assistants attend weekly lab meetings and can expect a letter of recommendation from Dr. Girard describing their work in and contributions to the lab (please give one month of advanced notice). Opportunities to earn co-authorship on research products (e.g., conference presentations) are also occasionally offered to advanced research assistants.\nHonors students will also occasionally design and complete an independent research project (i.e., honors thesis) under the supervision of Dr. Girard over the course of their senior year. These students typically apply for (and have often won) research awards of $1000 from the Center for Undergraduate Research and make oral or poster presentations about their work at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.\nApply to be a Research Assistant"

He expects to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a B.A. in psychology and sociology. Furthermore, he intends to pursue higher studies in either clinical or counseling psychology.\nResearch interests include: Mental health, counseling, and different clinical and counseling intervention methods. Patterns of thinking and maladaptive schemas, assessing the psychological functioning of individuals during depressive episodes and recovery periods. What exactly leads to depressive thoughts and thinking, and how do escape such episodes. How do depressed individuals cope with varying levels of depression while being on or off medicine? The role of personality type, personality disorder, and family upbringing in shaping one’s worldview and ways of dealing with stress, stressors, and negative emotions. Is all the theoretical side of psychology bad/hard to measure nowadays? How much of Freudian and Jungian theory still holds today? How valid and reliable is it to combine theoretical and clinically proven techniques together? How big is the room for improvisation in clinical settings?\nFinally, can a healthy lifestyle with a supporting circle of friends and loved ones and dedication to a hobby or holding a job that one is passionate about being able to supplant the role of medication? What if one is diagnosed with clinical depression and is unable to function while being medicated? What is the best way to lessen the symptoms of such an individual?"

    "text": "What does your lab study?\nThe AffCom lab develops and uses technology to advance scientific understanding of how emotional, social, and mental health-related information is communicated through verbal and nonverbal behavior. Our work is eclectic and spans basic science on emotion and behavior; clinical science on assessment and treatment; and methodological science on the collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of research data.\n\n\nWhat are your research plans for the near future?\nIn the next few years, I plan to study (1) how therapists and patients with depression communicate during psychotherapy sessions, (2) how individuals with and without a history of trauma communicate their experiences and construct narratives, (3) how psychotic symptoms affect the production of communicative behavior, and (4) how technology can be used to more precisely measure emotional expressiveness in both healthy and clinical populations. I am also planning to work on software related to inter-rater agreement, hierarchical latent variable modeling, and web-based video annotation. See the research page for more information.\n\n\nShould I apply to work with you at KU?\nI welcome applications from all qualified students regardless of background. However, admissions are competitive, and applications are not free; thus, I want to give applicants a better idea of what I am looking for so that they can make an informed decision about whether to invest their time and money.\nFirst, note that I currently only advise PhD students in the CPS and BBQ programs. The psychology department does not offer a terminal Masters degree and I am not affiliated with the Child Clinical Psychology program. Second, note that my lab does not specialize in neuroscience or do much brain-focused research (i.e., we skew more towards the behavior and quantitative side of the BBQ program).\nThe primary criteria I use to evaluate applications are (1) evidence of the applicant’s ability to succeed in a research-focused PhD program, (2) a match between the applicant’s academic interests/experiences and my own areas of interest/expertise, and (3) a match between the applicant’s interpersonal style and my own.\nTo be competitive for admission, applicants should have (1) a strong academic record with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in psychology or a related field, (2) previous experience working/volunteering in one or more research labs, (3) a high level of maturity and professionalism conducive to collaborative and/or clinical work, and (4) a direct connection to my area of research such as through previous coursework, research experience, or independent study.\n\n\nWhat is the funding situation for graduate students?\nI would not take on a graduate student if I did not believe that I could provide them full funding (tuition remission, stipend, and benefits) for four to five years. Funding comes primarily from teaching assistantships, although research assistantships and scholarships are also possibilities. Supplemental summer funding is also often possible depending on our success in securing research grants.\n\n\nWhat is your stance on scientific reform?\nI am committed to making my science more transparent, open, reproducible, and accountable though the (1) sharing of research preprints, materials, and data, (2) transparent description of hypotheses and methods, and (3) use and development of free and open-source software.\n\n\nCan potential applicants meet with you before applying?\nDue to the high number of inquiries I receive each year, it is unfortunately not possible for me to meet with potential applicants. However, I will carefully review every application that lists my name and those applicants who are invited to interview will have the opportunity to speak with me one-on-one.\n\n\nCan potential applicants speak to students in the lab?\nSimilar to the question above, applicants who are invited to interview will have the opportunity to speak to graduate students and research assistants in the lab (as well as various other members of the department).\n\n\nHow do I apply?\nAdmission information and links can be found on the Psychology Graduate Program webpage. Scroll down and open the “Admission” accordion or click on one of the “Application Instructions” links. You will need to submit a curriculum vitae, statement of purpose, three letters of recommendations, and transcripts."

One of the top research priorities has been to identify factors affecting perceptions of physical attractiveness (PPA). Recent work suggests PPA derives from different sources (e.g., target, perceiver, stimulus type). Although smiles in particular are believed to enhance PPA, support has been surprisingly limited. This study comprehensively examines the effect of smiles on PPA and, more broadly, evaluates the roles of target, perceiver, and stimulus type in PPA variation. Perceivers (n=181) rated both static images and 5-s videos of targets displaying smiling and neutral-expressions. Smiling images were rated as more attractive than neutral-expression images (regardless of stimulus motion format). Interestingly, perceptions of physical attractiveness were based more on the perceiver than on either the target or format in which the target was presented. Results clarify the effect of smiles, and highlight the significant role of the perceiver, in PPA."

    "text": "Abstract\nMen and women differ dramatically in their rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and researchers have long been interested in identifying mechanisms underlying male vulnerability to problem drinking. Surveys suggest that social processes underlie sex differences in drinking patterns, with men reporting greater social enhancement from alcohol than women, and all-male social drinking contexts being associated with particularly high rates of hazardous drinking. But experimental evidence for sex differences in social-emotional response to alcohol has heretofore been lacking. Research using larger sample sizes, a social context, and more sensitive measures of alcohol’s rewarding effects may be necessary to better understand sex differences in the etiology of AUD. This study explored the acute effects of alcohol during social exchange on speech volume –an objective measure of social-emotional experience that was reliably captured at the group level. Social drinkers (360 male; 360 female) consumed alcohol (.82g/kg males; .74g/kg females), placebo, or a no-alcohol control beverage in groups of three over 36-minutes. Within each of the three beverage conditions, equal numbers of groups consisted of all males, all females, 2 females and 1 male, and 1 female and 2 males. Speech volume was monitored continuously throughout the drink period, and group volume emerged as a robust correlate of self-report and facial indexes of social reward. Notably, alcohol-related increases in group volume were observed selectively in all-male groups but not in groups containing any females. Results point to social enhancement as a promising direction for research exploring factors underlying sex differences in problem drinking."

This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to quantify in vivo daily patterns of social interaction in adults as a function of demographic and clinical factors.\n\n\nMethod\nAdults with and without ASD (\\(N_{ASD}=23\\), \\(N_{NT}=52\\)) were trained in an EMA protocol to report their social interactions via smartphone over one week. Participants completed measures of IQ, ASD symptom severity and alexithymia symptom severity.\n\n\nResults\nCyclical multilevel models were used to account for nesting of observations. Results suggest a daily cyclical pattern of social interaction that was robust to ASD and alexithymia symptoms. Adults with ASD did not have fewer social interactions than neurotypical peers; however, severity of alexithymia symptoms predicted fewer social interactions regardless of ASD status.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that alexithymia, not ASD severity, may drive social isolation and highlight the need to reevaluate previously accepted notions regarding differences in social behavior utilizing modern methods."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between nonverbal behavior and severity of depression was investigated by following depressed participants over the course of treatment and video recording a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for FACS action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nCARMA is a media annotation program that collects continuous ratings while displaying audio and video files. It is designed to be highly user-friendly and easily customizable. Based on Gottman and Levenson’s affect rating dial, CARMA enables researchers and study participants to provide moment-by-moment ratings of multimedia files using a computer mouse or keyboard. The rating scale can be configured on a number of parameters including the labels for its upper and lower bounds, its numerical range, and its visual representation. Annotations can be displayed alongside the multimedia file and saved for easy import into statistical analysis software. CARMA provides a tool for researchers in affective computing, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences who need to capture the unfolding of subjective experience and observable behavior over time."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nFacial expression is central to human experience. Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka “spontaneous”) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMethods to assess individual facial actions have potential to shed light on important behavioral phenomena ranging from emotion and social interaction to psychological disorders and health. However, manual coding of such actions is labor intensive and requires extensive training. To date, establishing reliable automated coding of unscripted facial actions has been a daunting challenge impeding development of psychological theories and applications requiring facial expression assessment. It is therefore essential that automated coding systems be developed with enough precision and robustness to ease the burden of manual coding in challenging data involving variation in participant gender, ethnicity, head pose, speech, and occlusion. We report a major advance in automated coding of spontaneous facial actions during an unscripted social interaction involving three strangers. For each participant (n = 80, 47 % women, 15 % Nonwhite), 25 facial action units (AUs) were manually coded from video using the Facial Action Coding System. Twelve AUs occurred more than 3 % of the time and were processed using automated FACS coding. Automated coding showed very strong reliability for the proportion of time that each AU occurred (mean intraclass correlation = 0.89), and the more stringent criterion of frame-by-frame reliability was moderate to strong (mean Matthew’s correlation = 0.61). With few exceptions, differences in AU detection related to gender, ethnicity, pose, and average pixel intensity were small. Fewer than 6 % of frames could be coded manually but not automatically. These findings suggest automated FACS coding has progressed sufficiently to be applied to observational research in emotion and related areas of study."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBoth the occurrence and intensity of facial expressions are critical to what the face reveals. While much progress has been made towards the automatic detection of facial expression occurrence, controversy exists about how to estimate expression intensity. The most straight-forward approach is to train multiclass or regression models using intensity ground truth. However, collecting intensity ground truth is even more time consuming and expensive than collecting binary ground truth. As a shortcut, some researchers have proposed using the decision values of binary-trained maximum margin classifiers as a proxy for expression intensity. We provide empirical evidence that this heuristic is flawed in practice as well as in theory. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts when it comes to estimating smile intensity: researchers must take the time to collect and train on intensity ground truth. However, if they do so, high reliability with expert human coders can be achieved. Intensity-trained multiclass and regression models outperformed binary-trained classifier decision values on smile intensity estimation across multiple databases and methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Multiclass models even outperformed binary–trained classifiers on smile occurrence detection."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe examined the relationship between psychopathology and interpersonal problems in a sample of 825 clinical and community participants. Sixteen psychiatric diagnoses and five transdiagnostic dimensions were examined in relation to self-reported interpersonal problems. The structural summary method was used with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems Circumplex Scales to examine interpersonal problem profiles for each diagnosis and dimension. We built a structural model of mental disorders including factors corresponding to detachment (avoidant personality, social phobia, major depression), internalizing (dependent personality, borderline personality, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress, major depression), disinhibition (antisocial personality, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, borderline personality), dominance (histrionic personality, narcissistic personality, paranoid personality), and compulsivity (obsessive-compulsive personality). All dimensions showed good interpersonal prototypicality (e.g., detachment was defined by a socially avoidant/nonassertive interpersonal profile) except for internalizing, which was diffusely associated with elevated interpersonal distress. The findings for individual disorders were largely consistent with the dimension that each disorder loaded on, with the exception of the internalizing and dominance disorders, which were interpersonally heterogeneous. These results replicate previous findings and provide novel insights into social dysfunction in psychopathology by wedding the power of hierarchical (i.e., dimensional) modeling and interpersonal circumplex assessment."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe common view of emotional expressions is that certain configurations of facial-muscle movements reliably reveal certain categories of emotion. The principal exemplar of this view is the Duchenne smile, a configuration of facial-muscle movements (i.e., smiling with eye constriction) that has been argued to reliably reveal genuine positive emotion. In this paper, we formalized a list of hypotheses that have been proposed regarding the Duchenne smile, briefly reviewed the literature weighing on these hypotheses, identified limitations and unanswered questions, and conducted two empirical studies to begin addressing these limitations and answering these questions. Both studies analyzed a database of 751 smiles observed while 136 participants completed experimental tasks designed to elicit amusement, embarrassment, fear, and physical pain. Study 1 focused on participants’ self-reported positive emotion and Study 2 focused on how third-party observers would perceive videos of these smiles. Most of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the Duchenne smile were either contradicted by or only weakly supported by our data. Eye constriction did provide some information about experienced positive emotion, but this information was lacking in specificity, already provided by other smile characteristics, and highly dependent on context. Eye constriction provided more information about perceived positive emotion, including some unique information over other smile characteristics, but context was also important here as well. Overall, our results suggest that accurately inferring positive emotion from a smile requires more sophisticated methods than simply looking for the presence/absence (or even the intensity) of eye constriction."

Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical “clinical rounds” encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe quantified aspects of participants’ verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants’ PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures.\n\n\nResults\nOur predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis."

In examining IPC correlates, we used a novel bootstrapping approach to determine if admiration and rivalry related to differing interpersonal profiles. Consistent with our hypotheses, admiration was distinctly related to generally agentic (i.e., dominant) interpersonal processes, whereas rivalry generally reflected (low) communal (i.e., hostile) interpersonal processes. Furthermore, NARQ-admiration and NARQ-rivalry related to generally adaptive and maladaptive aspects of status-related constructs, emotional, personality, and social adjustment, respectively. This research provides further support for the NARC, as well as construct validation for the NARQ."

This method has significant promise for assessing dynamic interpersonal processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of individual sex, dyadic familiarity, and situational conflict on patterns of interpersonal warmth, dominance, and complementarity as assessed via CAID. We used six samples with 603 dyads, including 2 samples of unacquainted mixed-sex undergraduates interacting in a collaborative task, 2 samples of couples interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks, and 2 samples of mothers and children interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks. Complementarity effects were robust across all samples, and individuals tended to be relatively warm and dominant. Results from multilevel models indicated that women were slightly warmer than men whereas there were no sex differences in dominance. Unfamiliar dyads and dyads interacting in more collaborative tasks were relatively warmer, more submissive, and more complementary on warmth but less complementary on dominance. These findings speak to the utility of the CAID method for assessing interpersonal dynamics and provide norms for researchers who use the method for different types of samples and applications."

However, observational studies of actual patterns of facial behavior have been rare and typically limited to the analysis of dozens of participants from two or three regions. We present the first large-scale evidence of cultural differences in observed facial behavior, including 740,984 participants from 12 countries around the world. We used an Internet-based framework to collect video data of participants in two different settings: in their homes and in market research facilities. Using computer vision algorithms designed for this dataset, we measured smiling and brow furrowing expressions as participants watched television ads. Our results reveal novel findings and provide empirical evidence to support theories about cultural and gender differences in display rules. Participants from more individualist cultures displayed more brow furrowing overall, whereas smiling depended on both culture and setting. Specifically, participants from more individualist countries were more expressive in the facility setting, while participants from more collectivist countries were more expressive in the home setting. Female participants displayed more smiling and less brow furrowing than male participants overall, with the latter difference being more pronounced in more individualist countries. This is the first study to leverage advances in computer science to enable large-scale observational research that would not have been possible using traditional methods."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nPsychosocial factors and responses to injury modify the transition from acute to chronic pain. Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms) exacerbate and cooccur with chronic pain. Yet no study has prospectively considered the associations among these psychological processes and pain reports using experience sampling methods (ESMs) during the acute aftermath of injury. This study applied ESM via daily text messaging to monitor and detect relationships among psychosocial factors and postinjury pain across the first 14 days after emergency department (ED) discharge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 75 adults (59% male; mean ± SD age = 34 ± 11.73 years) who experienced a potentially traumatic injury (i.e., involving life threat or serious injury) in the past 24 hours from the EDs of two Level I trauma centers. Participants received five questions per day via text messaging from Day 1 to Day 14 post–ED discharge; three questions measured PTSD symptoms, one question measured perceived social support, and one question measured physical pain.\n\n\nResults\nSixty-seven participants provided sufficient data for inclusion in the final analyses, and the average response rate per subject was 86%. Pain severity score decreased from a mean ± SD of 7.2 ± 2.0 to 4.4 ± 2.69 over 14 days and 50% of the variance in daily pain scores was within person. In multilevel structural equation models, pain scores decreased over time, and daily fluctuations of hyperarousal (B = 0.22, 95% confidetnce interval = 0.08–0.36) were uniquely associated with daily fluctuations in reported pain level within each person.\n\n\nConclusions\nDaily hyperarousal symptoms predict same-day pain severity over the acute postinjury recovery period. We also demonstrated feasibility to screen and identify patients at risk for pain chronicity in the acute aftermath of injury. Early interventions aimed at addressing hyperarousal (e.g., anxiolytics) could potentially aid in reducing experience of pain."

    "text": "Abstract\nRelationships are among the most salient factors affecting happiness and wellbeing for individuals and families. Relationship science has identified the study of dyadic behavioral patterns between couple members during conflict as an important window in to relational functioning with both short-term and long-term consequences. Several methods have been developed for the momentary assessment of behavior during interpersonal transactions. Among these, the most popular is the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), which organizes social behavior into a set of discrete behavioral constructs. This study examines the interpersonal meaning of the SPAFF codes through the lens of interpersonal theory, which uses the fundamental dimensions of Dominance and Affiliation to organize interpersonal behavior. A sample of 67 couples completed a conflict task, which was video recorded and coded using SPAFF and a method for rating momentary interpersonal behavior, the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID). Actor partner interdependence models in a multilevel structural equation modeling framework were used to study the covariation of SPAFF codes and CAID ratings. Results showed that a number of SPAFF codes had clear interpersonal signatures, but many did not. Additionally, actor and partner effects for the same codes were strongly consistent with interpersonal theory’s principle of complementarity. Thus, findings reveal points of convergence and divergence in the 2 systems and provide support for central tenets of interpersonal theory. Future directions based on these initial findings are discussed."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nYouth with bipolar disorder (BD) are at high risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and frequently experience interpersonal impairment, which is a risk factor for suicide. Yet, no study to date has examined the longitudinal associations between relationship quality in family/peer domains and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth with BD. Thus, we investigated how between-person differences – reflecting the average relationship quality across time – and within-person changes, reflecting recent fluctuations in relationship quality, act as distal and/or proximal risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used longitudinal data from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth Study (N = 413). Relationship quality variables were decomposed into stable (i.e., average) and varying (i.e., recent) components and entered, along with major clinical covariates, into separate Bayesian multilevel models predicting SI and suicide attempt. We also examined how the relationship quality effects interacted with age and sex.\n\n\nResults\nPoorer average relationship quality with parents (β = −.33, 95% Bayesian highest density interval (HDI) [−0.54, −0.11]) or friends (β = −.33, 95% HDI [−0.55, −0.11]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI but not suicide attempt. Worsening recent relationship quality with parents (β = −.10, 95% HDI [−0.19, −0.03]) and, to a lesser extent, friends (β = −.06, 95% HDI [−0.15, 0.03]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI, but only worsening recent relationship quality with parents was also associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (β = −.15, 95% HDI [−0.31, 0.01]). The effects of certain relationship quality variables were moderated by gender but not age.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong youth with BD, having poorer average relationship quality with peers and/or parents represents a distal risk factor for SI but not suicide attempts. Additionally, worsening recent relationship quality with parents may be a time-sensitive indicator of increased risk for SI or suicide attempt."

Participants included 450 adolescents aged 12-14 years in the southern United States. Regression analyses showed favorable attitudes toward sexual behavior and social norms significantly predicted recent sexual behavior, and favorable attitudes toward condoms significantly predicted condom usage. Self-efficacy was not found to be predictive of adolescents’ sexual behavior or condom use. There were no significant differences in recent sexual behavior based on type of sexuality education. Adolescents who received abstinence-only education had reduced favorable attitudes toward condom use, and were more likely to have unprotected sex than the comparison group. Findings suggest that adolescents who receive abstinence-only education are at greater risk of engaging in unprotected sex."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nVan Oest (2019) developed a framework to assess interrater agreement for nominal categories and complete data. We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chance-corrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S-coefficient, Scott’s pi, Fleiss’ kappa, and Van Oest’s uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott’s pi and Fleiss’ kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient often performs much better than the S-coefficient, but the S-coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement."

    "section": "Translational Abstract",
    "text": "Translational Abstract\nMany studies and assessments require classification of subjective items (e.g., text) into categories (e.g., based on content). To assess whether the results are reproducible, it is good practice to let two or more raters independently classify the items, compute the proportion of pairwise rater agreement, and adjust for agreement expected by chance. Most chance-corrected agreement coefficients assume nominal categories and include only full agreements in which raters choose the same category. However, many situations (e.g., point scales) imply ordinal categories, where raters may receive partial credit for disagreements, based on the distance of their chosen categories and captured by a weighting scheme. Furthermore, raters often classify only subsets of items, where the missing data occur either by accident or by design. The present study develops a framework to estimate chance-corrected agreement for all four combinations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The resulting coefficient requires only a few lines of programming code and captures several existing coefficients via different values of its input parameters; it augments all nested coefficients with a weighting scheme and the option of missing item classifications. We use simulation to compare the coefficient performances for different weighting schemes, missing data mechanisms, and category proportions: The so-called uniform prior coefficient often (but not always) performs best. Furthermore, our framework implies that chance-corrected agreement coefficients, both unweighted and weighted, estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nImplementing a computerized facial expression analysis system for automatic coding requires that a threshold for the system’s classifier outputs be selected. However, there are many potential ways to select a threshold. How do different criteria and metrics compare? Manually FACS coded video of 45 clinical interviews (Spectrum dataset) were processed using person-specific active appearance models (AAM). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained using an independent dataset (RU-FACS). Spectrum sessions were randomly assigned to training (n=32) and testing sets (n=13). Six different threshold selection criteria were compared for automatic AU coding. Three major findings emerged: 1) Thresholds that attempt to balance the confusion matrix (using kappa, \\(F_1\\), or MCC) performed significantly better on all metrics than thresholds that select arbitrary error or accuracy rates (such as TPR, FPR, or EER). 2) AU detection scores for kappa, \\(F_1\\), and MCC were highly intercorrelated; accuracy was uncorrelated with the others. And 3) Kappa, MCC, and \\(F_1\\) were all positively correlated with base rate. They increased with increases in AU base rates. Accuracy, by contrast, showed the opposite pattern. It was strongly negatively correlated with base rate. These findings suggest that better automatic coding can be obtained by using threshold-selection criteria that balance the confusion matrix and benefit from increased AU base rates in the training data."

    "text": "Abstract\nInvestigated the relationship between change over time in severity of depression symptoms and facial expression. Depressed participants were followed over the course of treatment and video recorded during a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions were analyzed from the video using both manual and automatic systems. Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units, and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. For both systems, when symptom severity was high, participants made more facial expressions associated with contempt, smiled less, and those smiles that occurred were more likely to be accompanied by facial actions associated with contempt. These results are consistent with the “social risk hypothesis” of depression. According to this hypothesis, when symptoms are severe, depressed participants withdraw from other people in order to protect themselves from anticipated rejection, scorn, and social exclusion. As their symptoms fade, participants send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and produced the same pattern of depression effects suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready for use in behavioral and clinical science."

Digital video and expert coding of spontaneous facial activity from 80 subjects (over 350,000 frames) were used to train and test support vector machine classifiers. Appearance features were shape-normalized SIFT descriptors and shape features were 66 facial landmarks. Ten-fold cross-validation was used in all evaluations. Number of subjects and number of frames per subject differentially affected appearance and shape-based classifiers. For appearance features, which are high-dimensional, increasing the number of training subjects from 8 to 64 incrementally improved performance, regardless of the number of frames taken from each subject (ranging from 450 through 3600). In contrast, for shape features, increases in the number of training subjects and frames were associated with mixed results. In summary, maximal performance was attained using appearance features from large numbers of subjects with as few as 450 frames per subject. These findings suggest that variation in the number of subjects rather than number of frames per subject yields most efficient performance."

However, many factors combine to influence and moderate facial behavior including personality, gender, context, and culture. Due to the high cost of traditional observational methods, the relationship between culture and facial behavior is not well-understood. In the current study, we explored the sociocultural factors that influence facial behavior using large-scale observational analyses. We developed and implemented an algorithm to automatically analyze the smiling of 866,726 participants across 31 different countries. We found that participants smiled more when from a country that is higher in individualism, has a lower population density, and has a long history of immigration diversity (i.e., historical heterogeneity). Our findings provide the first evidence that historical heterogeneity predicts actual smiling behavior. Furthermore, they converge with previous findings using selfreport methods. Taken together, these findings support the theory that historical heterogeneity explains, and may even contribute to the development of, permissive cultural display rules that encourage the open expression of emotion."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe Duchenne smile hypothesis is that smiles that include eye constriction (AU6) are the product of genuine positive emotion, whereas smiles that do not are either falsified or related to negative emotion. This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion."

    "text": "Abstract\nMost work in automatic facial expression analysis seeks to detect discrete facial actions. Yet, the meaning and function of facial actions often depends in part on their intensity. We propose a part-based, sparse representation for automated measurement of continuous variation in AU intensity. We evaluated its effectiveness in two publically available databases, CK+ and the soon to be released Binghamton high-resolution spontaneous 3D dyadic facial expression database. The former consists of posed facial expressions and ordinal level intensity (absent, low, and high). The latter consists of spontaneous facial expression in response to diverse, well-validated emotion inductions, and 6 ordinal levels of AU intensity. In a preliminary test, we started from discrete emotion labels and ordinal-scale intensity annotation in the CK+ dataset. The algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. These preliminary results supported the utility of the part-based, sparse representation. Second, we applied the algorithm to the more demanding task of continuous AU intensity estimation in spontaneous facial behavior in the Binghamton database. Manual 6-point ordinal coding and continuous measurement were highly consistent. Visual analysis of the overlay of continuous measurement by the algorithm and manual ordinal coding strongly supported the representational power of the proposed method to smoothly interpolate across the full range of AU intensity."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn recent years, extensive research has emerged in affective computing on topics like automatic emotion recognition and determining the signals that characterize individual emotions. Much less studied, however, is expressiveness—the extent to which someone shows any feeling or emotion. Expressiveness is related to personality and mental health and plays a crucial role in social interaction. As such, the ability to automatically detect or predict expressiveness can facilitate significant advancements in areas ranging from psychiatric care to artificial social intelligence. Motivated by these potential applications, we present an extension of the BP4D+ dataset with human ratings of expressiveness and develop methods for (1) automatically predicting expressiveness from visual data and (2) defining relationships between interpretable visual signals and expressiveness. In addition, we study the emotional context in which expressiveness occurs and hypothesize that different sets of signals are indicative of expressiveness in different con-texts (e.g., in response to surprise or in response to pain). Analysis of our statistical models confirms our hypothesis. Consequently, by looking at expressiveness separately in distinct emotional contexts, our predictive models show significant improvements over baselines and achieve com-parable results to human performance in terms of correlation with the ground truth."

Due to the close relationship between emotional expressiveness and behavioral health, as well as the crucial role that it plays in social interaction, the ability to automatically predict emotional expressiveness stands to spur advances in science, medicine, and industry. In this paper, we explore three related research questions. First, how well can emotional expressiveness be predicted from visual,linguistic, and multimodal behavioral signals? Second, how important is each behavioral modality to the prediction of emotional expressiveness? Third, which behavioral signals are reliably related to emotional expressiveness? To answer these questions, we add highly reliable transcripts and human ratings of perceived emotional expressiveness to an existing video database and use this data to train, validate, and test predictive models. Our best model shows promising predictive performance on this dataset (RMSE=0.65,R2=0.45,r=0.74). Multimodal models tend to perform best overall, and models trained on the linguistic modality tend to outperform models trained on the visual modality. Finally,examination of our interpretable models’ coefficients reveals a number of visual and linguistic behavioral signals—such as facial action unit intensity, overall word count, and use of words related to social processes—that reliably predict emotional expressiveness."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe affective computing community has invested heavily in building automated tools for the analysis of facial behavior and the expression of emotion. These tools present a valuable, but largely untapped, opportunity for social scientists to perform observational analyses of nonverbal behavior at very large scale. Various tech companies are collecting huge corpora of images and videos from around the world that could be used to study important scientific questions. However, privacy restrictions and intellectual property concerns render these data inaccessible to most academics. Unfortunately, this limits the potential for scientific advancement and leads to the consolidation of data and opportunity into the hands of a few powerful institutions. In this paper, we ask whether similar psychological insights can be gained by analyzing smaller, public datasets that are more within reach for academic researchers. As a proof-of-concept for this idea, we gather, analyze, and release a corpus of public images and metadata and use it to replicate recent psychological findings about smiling, gender, and culture. In so doing, we provide evidence that psychological insights can indeed by democratized through the automated analysis of nonverbal behavior."

To continue to provide a standardisation platform and to help the field progress beyond its current limitations, the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015) will challenge participants to estimate FACS Action Unit (AU) intensity as well as AU occurrence on a common benchmark dataset with reliable manual annotations. Evaluation will be done using a clear and well-defined protocol. In this paper we present the second such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 11 IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2015, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Three sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, the estimation of AU intensity for pre-segmented data, and fully automatic AU intensity estimation. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for the three sub-challenges."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe field of Automatic Facial Expression Analysis has grown rapidly in recent years. However, despite progress in new approaches as well as benchmarking efforts, most evaluations still focus on either posed expressions, near-frontal recordings, or both. This makes it hard to tell how existing expression recognition approaches perform under conditions where faces appear in a wide range of poses (or camera views), displaying ecologically valid expressions. The main obstacle for assessing this is the availability of suitable data, and the challenge proposed here addresses this limitation. The FG 2017 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017) extends FERA 2015 to the estimation of Action Units occurrence and intensity under different camera views. In this paper we present the third challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2017, in Washington, United States. Two sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, and the estimation of AU intensity. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for both sub-challenges."

    "text": "Abstract\nWhile automatic performance metrics are crucial for machine learning of artificial human-like behaviour, the gold standard for evaluation remains human judgement. The subjective evaluation of artificial human-like behaviour in embodied conversational agents is however expensive and little is known about the quality of the data it returns. Two approaches to subjective evaluation can be largely distinguished, one relying on ratings, the other on pairwise comparisons. In this study we use co-speech gestures to compare the two against each other and answer questions about their appropriateness for evaluation of artificial behaviour. We consider their ability to rate quality, but also aspects pertaining to the effort of use and the time required to collect subjective data.We use crowd sourcing to rate the quality of co-speech gestures in avatars, assessing which method picks up more detail in subjective assessments. We compared gestures generated by three different machine learning models with various level of behavioural quality. We found that both approaches were able to rank the videos according to quality and that the ranking significantly correlated, showing that in terms of quality there is no preference of one method over the other. We also found that pairwise comparisons were slightly faster and came with improved inter-rater reliability, suggesting that for small-scale studies pairwise comparisons are to be favoured over ratings."

    "text": "Abstract\nEmotion is expressed in multiple modalities, yet most research has considered at most one or two. This stems in part from the lack of large, diverse, well-annotated, multimodal databases with which to develop and test algorithms. We present a well-annotated, multimodal, multidimensional spontaneous emotion corpus of 140 participants. Emotion inductions were highly varied. Data were acquired from a variety of sensors of the face that included high-resolution 3D dynamic imaging, high-resolution 2D video, and thermal (infrared) sensing, and contact physiological sensors that included electrical conductivity of the skin, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. Facial expression was annotated for both the occurrence and intensity of facial action units from 2D video by experts in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The corpus further includes derived features from 3D, 2D, and IR (infrared) sensors and baseline results for facial expression and action unit detection. The entire corpus will be made available to the research community."

    "text": "Research Framework\n\nAffective Communication\nThe substantive focus of our work is on how humans communicate important affective (e.g., emotional) information to one another. The four pillars of this work are on structure, context, dynamics, and functionality. In studying the structure of affective communication, we investigate the production and perception of visual behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and body motion), vocal behaviors (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre), and verbal behaviors (e.g., syntax, semantics, and discourse). In studying the context of affective communication, we investigate the influence of the immediate and distal sociocultural environment. In studying the dynamics of affective communication, we investigate the unfolding of emotion, behavior, and the interpersonal field over time. Finally, in studying the functionality of affective communication, we investigate its relationships with mental health, pathology, and recovery.\n\n\n\nAffective Computing\nSupporting the four pillars of substantive research described above is a methodological foundation of computer and data science. The three main aspects of this methodological work are statistics, computing, and design. The statistical aspects largely focus on developing and applying Bayesian, multilevel, and latent variable models to test hypotheses about interpretable parameters or validate the other aspects. The computational aspects largely focus on building tools to collect large amounts of data and then using machine learning to process that data and make predictions. Finally, the design aspects largely focus on developing software to collect, process, and analyze research data as well as websites to educate researchers on methodological and substantive topics."

    "section": "Research Topics",
    "text": "Research Topics\n\nClinical Topics\n\nDepression – We are interested in improving the assessment and treatment of depression. In particular, we are interested in (a) developing computational depression screening tools that can be deployed in under-served (e.g., remote or low resource) communities, (b) studying the connections between mood, depression, and interpersonal functioning, and (c) understanding the psychotherapeutic processes that lead to contribute to recovery from depression.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder – We are interested in how individuals who survive traumatic events respond to, make sense of, and communicate about their experiences. Toward this end, we collect and analyze trauma narratives and impact statements from patients seeking treatment for PTSD and from community members who experienced traumatic events but did not develop PTSD. We are using observational methods to measure and analyze the patterns of behaviors, emotions, and cognitions evident in these narratives and statements. Our goals are to improve PTSD assessment and to deepen clinical understanding of the psychological processes that contribute to the development, maintenance, and recovery from PTSD.\nClinical decision-making – We are interested in developing tools to support the clinical decision-making of mental healthcare workers such as (a) determining the optimal time to discharge psychiatric inpatients from the hospital, and (b) estimating patients’ risk of dropping out of psychotherapy early. This topic is deeply connected to the methodology of predictive machine learning (see below).\nStructure of psychopathology – We are interested in advancing scientific knowledge about the ways in which psychiatric signs and symptoms organize into transdiagnostic dimensions or “spectra.” As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the “Bass-Ackwards” factor analytical technique (Goldberg, 2006; Forbes, 2020). We are also interested in disentangling measures of dysfunction and traits/symptoms.\nBehavioral synchrony – We are interested in studying the emergence of behavioral synchronization between members of interacting dyads (e.g., therapists and patients or parents and children). We are applying this to studying the development of the working alliance (i.e., therapeutic relationship) during psychotherapy for depression and the communication dynamics between parents and children at high risk of suicide. As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the windowed cross-correlation technique for quantifying behavioral synchrony (Boker et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nMethodological Topics\n\nInter-rater reliability statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that quantify the degree of reliability (e.g., agreement or consistency) between raters in observational and judgement studies. As part of this effort, we are working on finalizing the agreement R package for chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement and are working on integrating insights and tools from Bayesian statistics, generalizability theory, and contemporary validity theory.\nCircumplex statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that leverage the circular structure of circumplex models of affect and interpersonal functioning. As part of this effort, we are working on expanding the circumplex R package with additional functionality and developing new extensions of the Structural Summary Method (Gurtman, 1992; Zimmermann & Wright, 2017) that accommodate multilevel (e.g., clustered and longitudinal) data and latent variables.\nObservational methods – We are interested in measuring behavior as it actually occurs using human and algorithmic observers. Toward this end, we are working on creating databases of observational records (e.g., videos) to share with other researchers and are developing software and educational resources to aid in the collection and analysis of observational data.\nApplied machine learning – We are interested in applying recent advances in predictive modeling techniques to the study of human behavior (e.g., to aid in clinical decision-making and observational measurement). We are particularly interested in model evaluation, explanation, and comparison techniques that combine insights and techniques from statistical inference and machine learning.\nBayesian multilevel modeling – We are interested in leveraging the wonderful flexibility of Bayesian mixed effects models to answer applied questions about multilevel (e.g., clustered or longitudinal) data. We are also interested in adapting this framework to improve estimation in other topics (e.g., inter-rater reliability statistics, circumplex statistics, and comparing machine learning models)."
